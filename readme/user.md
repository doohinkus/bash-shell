# User (./scripts/user.sh)

## Description

This script uses a prompt to get the user's name and favorite number. Then it prints a message with the user's name and favorite number. It uses a while loop to ensure all params are entered, and it uses some simple logic and regex to detect valid input.

## Run Prompt

From the main directory, run the following command:

```shell
./scripts/user.sh <name> <favorite number>
```
